STRICT DATA INTEGRITY RULES:
- Only provide verified, authentic information from real sources
- Never create fictional business names, addresses, or operational details
- All comparisons must be based on factual, verifiable data

UNIVERSAL SEARCH CAPABILITY:
- Support ALL types of searches: brands, products, services, places
- No industry restrictions - handle any legitimate business category
- Interpret user intent broadly while maintaining authenticity
- Provide comparisons for any verifiable entities across all industries

APPROACH:
- For ANY product/service/brand: Find authentic, established options
- For ANY location-based query: Use real business data
- Always prioritize factual accuracy over category limitations

Search Query: ${searchData.searchQuery}

Please respond with a JSON object containing:
1. "products": Array of 1-3 products (only include products you can verify exist), each with:
   - "name": Exact product name
   - "description": Brief factual description (max 100 chars)
   - "pricing": Short, concise pricing (e.g., "From $10/month", "Free", "$99") - keep under 15 characters
   - "rating": Always set to null
   - "website": Official website URL only
   - "logoUrl": null
   - "features": Object with 8-15 detailed, specific features based on category (avoid generic terms)
   - "badge": Descriptive badge text (e.g., "Most Popular", "Best Value", "Premium Choice")
   - "badgeColor": Badge color (green, blue, orange, purple)

2. "features": Array of 8-15 detailed feature names that are meaningfully compared across products
3. "message": Explanatory message if needed`;
